Subsystem definition and interfaces

The propulsion subsystem is responsible for successfully providing enough thrust to the airframe in order to fulfill mission requirements.

Inputs:
Flight Conditions:
Mach Number
Altitude
Temp
Aircraft Inputs:
Throttle Control
Fuel

Outputs:
Thrust
TSFC
Power (for hybrid)

Coupled Subsystems:
Mission
Mass/Cost
Emissions

Hybrid Electric Propulsion 
Increase thrust by 46.85%
Reduce SFC by 4.20%

NOTES
Mass:
Probably going to Increase
Ideas: get rid of all aliuminum and replace with lighter material approved by FAA (potentially)
Look into new materials


Propulsion:
hybrid propulsion parallel

Dr Harvey

Build another external subsystem instead of editing engine decks
Maybe pivot to doing Cost

Look at pivoting out of propulsion

Realistic is adding and subtracting Subsystems

Engine decks are proprietary

try linking in pycycle (links engine performance)

Try using a scaling value and optimize that for the mission

Goal:
Number of engines
Scaling of engines
